## Getting started

Install `protoc` for generating definitions based on `.proto` files

```shell
brew install protobuf
protoc --version  # Ensure compiler version is 3+
```

Prepare environment
```shell
yarn install
yarn lerna bootstrap
```

Build common packages, so we're able to use it for our services
```shell
yarn lerna run build --scope=@common/*
```
